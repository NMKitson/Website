                <p>Loving plants is one thing, keeping them alive is another...and where the journey of Plant Envy
                    began!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I do not know about you, but it seems only natural when you get a new house you get a new plant, or
                    two, then the collection really starts to grow, before you know it you have a jungle.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Even with some TLC, in our house it seemed potluck if they survived, a topic that came up amongst
                    friends, where we all agreed we could kill a cactus between us!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over a glass of vino, before we knew it the challenge was set, at the time I'm not sure we knew what
                    the challenge was but we accepted.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From then on there was some friendly competition, lots of plant spam and a new level of plant chat
                    and Plant Envy was born.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Then we invited the nation of Plant lovers to join our little community and the rest is history as
                    they say!</p>
